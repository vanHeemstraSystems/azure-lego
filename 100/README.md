# 100 - Introduction

We aim to compare Azure 'building blocks' with LEGO building bricks, to simplify the understanding of how Azure is 'constructed'.

For example:

### Azure Virtual Network:

*"Azure Virtual Network is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. A virtual network is a virtual, isolated portion of Azure public network. Use VNets for communication between Azure resources, the internet, and on-premises networks."*

### LEGO Baseplate:

*"A Baseplate is a large flat plate in many colors, on which structures are often built ontop of. They can be bought as sets like 628 X-Large Grey Baseplate or come in sets that contain buildings. Compared to regular plate elements, baseplates are thinner and flat and their undersides cannot be connected to other studded pieces."*
