# 200 - Requirements

Before we start, you need the following:

1. A domain name. We used [freenom.com](http://freenom.com/) in this example, and created ```serverlessexample.ga```
2. [git](https://git-scm.com/) for source control
3. Ensure you have the [Azure CLI utilities](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli).<br/> 
On OSX with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): ```$ brew install azure-cli```
4. Login to Azure on the command line: ```az login```
5. Ensure your Default Azure subscription is what you want to use for this. *See great instructions in [terraform docs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/authenticating_via_azure_cli.html) here*.
6. Clone the sample code repo: <br/>
```$ git clone git@github.com:dcolebatch/azure_serverless_example.git```
7. Initialize your terraform, which downloads any providers we depend on: terraform init

Great, now youâ€™re ready to tweak our terraform to your liking and see what affects your changes will have using the terraform plan command.
